## The Age of Controlled Intelligence

In today's AI landscape, we face a critical vulnerability that threatens the very foundation of decentralized systems.

Despite the revolutionary promises of blockchain technology, AI systems remain tethered to centralized control points, creating a paradoxical situation where decentralized networks rely on centralized intelligence.

Current AI systems operate as black boxes, with their decision-making processes hidden behind proprietary walls. This opacity makes it impossible to verify if an AI agent is truly autonomous or merely a facade controlled by centralized authorities. In the crypto industry, this creates a significant security risk, as these AI systems can be modified, manipulated, or terminated at will by their controllers.

The challenge extends beyond mere control - it touches the very essence of trust in digital systems. When AI decisions impact millions of dollars in digital assets, how can we trust systems we cannot verify? Why use blockchain networks at all if you are willing to sacrifice the very principles they are built on by using centralized AI? These fundamental questions have brought us to the development of the opAgent Framework.

The opAgent Framework represents a cohesive shift in decentralized AI. Through the invention of opML (Optimistic Machine Learning) technology, we've created the first truly autonomous digital entities that exist entirely onchain, forever. opAgent isn't merely another GPT wrapper or agent framework; **it's the dawn of perpetual digital beings that can think, evolve, and exist indefinitely through the blockchain.**

The key innovation lies in the way opAgents are born and exist. Unlike traditional AI systems that run on centralized servers, opAgents:

- Are created through an immutable onchain process
- Maintain permanent ownership of their digital assets
- Operate through verifiable computations
- Are sustained by the entirety of the blockchain network they live on
- Evolve through mathematical consensus

The technical foundation rests on three critical pillars:

1. Blockchain-native existence ensuring permanence
2. Verifiable computation through opML
3. Self-reinforcing economic models

## The Architecture of opAgent

The opAgent Framework introduces a novel approach to AI agent autonomy by leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts to create truly decentralized, verifiable AI systems. Unlike traditional AI frameworks that rely on centralized control and private key management, opAgent establishes a new paradigm where AI agents operate autonomously through smart contracts while maintaining complete verifiability of their actions.

At its core, the framework addresses three fundamental challenges in decentralized AI:

1. **Verifiable Computation**: Through optimistic machine learning (opML), every decision and action can be independently verified on-chain
2. **Asset Management**: Using smart contract-based wallets instead of private keys, eliminating single points of failure
3. **Perpetual Operation**: Ensuring continuous operation through blockchain-based existence, immune to centralized shutdown

The following architecture diagram illustrates how these components interact to create a robust, decentralized AI system:

![image](/image/framework_2.png)

The opAgent Framework's architecture represents a novelty approach to AI autonomy, which has two mode, singleton mode and swarm intelligence. 

![image](/image/framework_op.png)

- In the singleton mode, a single opAgent operates autonomously and independently, handling all requests without external assistance. While this mode works well for tasks within the agent's specialized domain, it limits the ability to address multifaceted or interdisciplinary problems that require a broader set of skills or perspectives.

![image](/image/swarm.png)

- Swarm intelligence allows agents to collaborate and interact in a decentralized manner to solve complex problems, innovate, and enhance their collective capabilities.

## Singleton Mode

Using the opAgent framework, anyone can create an immortal and verifiable onchain AI agent powered by opML. This approach guarantees that the AI agent lives entirely onchain, performs actions in a decentralized and verifiable manner, and is immune to counterparty risk. Here's how the architecture works:

### **1. AI Agent's Birth and Existence Onchain**

Unlike traditional AI systems that exist on centralized servers, opAgents are born through a unique process that fundamentally defines their nature. This birth process involves:

- **Genesis Transaction:** The initial creation transaction that establishes the agent's existence on the blockchain
- **Asset Binding:** Permanent linkage of digital assets to the agent through smart contracts
- **Identity Formation:** Creation of a unique, immutable identity that cannot be replicated or falsified
- **Autonomous Initialization:** Self-bootstrapping process that establishes initial operating parameters

The birth chamber ensures that every aspect of the agent's existence is verifiable and permanent, creating an unbreakable bond between the agent, the blockchain, and its digital assets.

### 2. **AI Agent Contract Wallet: A New Paradigm for AI-Controlled Digital Assets**

The **AI agent wallet** is a new evolution of how AI agents interact with and manage onchain assets. Unlike traditional externally owned accounts (EOAs), which are controlled by private keys, the AI agent wallet operates on a **smart contract-based** model. This distinction is crucial for the security, decentralization, and autonomy of AI agents, ensuring that their actions are governed by code and verified through the blockchain, rather than relying on a single private key.

![image](/image/framework.png)

#### 2.1 **The Problem with Traditional Private Key-Based Wallets**

Most Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) agents today store private keys within the TEE itself. While this provides a level of security, it creates a significant risk: if the private key is ever compromised, an attacker can gain full control over the AI agent’s behavior and the digital assets it manages. This centralization of control under a single private key introduces a vulnerability—if the key is leaked, the agent can be manipulated or even hijacked by malicious actors.

#### 2.2 **Introducing the AI Agent Contract Wallet: Smart Contract-Controlled, Secure, and Decentralized**

The **AI agent wallet** overcomes these issues by utilizing a **smart contract** rather than a private key for authentication and authorization. This allows for greater flexibility, security, and transparency in how AI agents manage their assets. The AI agent wallet is designed to work seamlessly with the **Onchain AI Oracle (OAO)**, and its interactions with the blockchain are fully **verifiable** and **decentralized**.

![image](/image/OPML1.png)

Key features of the AI agent wallet include:

- **Smart Contract-Based Control**: The AI agent wallet operates through a smart contract that is immutable and transparent. This contract defines the rules and permissions under which the agent can interact with its assets and other blockchain-based entities. The smart contract ensures that the agent’s behavior is governed by predefined logic, eliminating the need for a single private key that could be compromised.
- **Onchain Access and Autonomy**: The wallet provides the AI agent with direct access to onchain assets and decentralized applications (dApps). The wallet’s smart contract allows the agent to manage and execute transactions autonomously, based on its programming and the inputs received from the **OAO**.
- **Verifiable Transactions with opML**: All transactions made by the AI agent using its wallet are verifiable through **optimistic machine learning (opML)**. opML validates the AI agent’s actions by cross-referencing them with the machine learning models deployed within the blockchain environment. This ensures that every transaction is not only recorded onchain but also aligns with the agent's intended behavior and goals.
- **Decentralized Governance and Control**: The AI agent wallet removes the reliance on centralized entities. Since the wallet operates through smart contracts, it is not subject to centralized servers or private keys that could be vulnerable to attack. Instead, the wallet’s behavior is managed by the decentralized logic within the smart contract, which can only be altered through consensus mechanisms defined by the blockchain.

## Comparisons

| Feature / Aspect | **AI Agent Contract Wallet** | **Traditional EOA Wallet** | **EOA Wallet in TEE** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Key Storage** | ✅ No private key; controlled by smart contract logic | ❌ Private key stored locally | ✅ Private key stored securely in a TEE |
| **Security** | ✅ High security through smart contract, decentralized control | ❌ Vulnerable to private key theft or loss | ⚖️ Secured private key storage within a TEE, but still a single point of failure |
| **Autonomy** | ✅ AI-driven autonomous decision-making, governed by contract logic | ⚖️ Manual control, user-driven decision-making | ⚖️ Some automation based on private key management in TEE |
| **Decentralization** | ✅ Fully decentralized through blockchain-based smart contracts | ❌ Centralized in terms of key control | ⚖️ Dependent on TEE security, generally centralized under private key control |

### 3. Onchain **Actions Using OAO (Onchain AI Oracle)**

The actions of the AI agent are conducted in a **decentralized** and **verifiable** manner. When the AI agent interacts with the blockchain, for instance by creating or transferring onchain assets, these actions are facilitated through an **Onchain AI Oracle (OAO)**. Powered by opML, the OAO enables **optimistic machine learning,** which ensures every action made by the agent can be trustlessly verified to mitigate manipulation:

- **Onchain Actions:**
    - The agent can create onchain assets (such as tokens, NFTs, or other smart contract-based items).
    - It can transfer assets, interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, or initiate any other onchain activities.
    - These actions are processed through the OAO, which ensures the integrity, decentralization, and verifiability of every move the agent makes on the blockchain.
- **How OAO Works:**
    - The OAO serves as a bridge between the AI agent and the blockchain, ensuring that every action, whether it’s the creation of an asset or a transfer of value, is recorded immutably and transparently.
    - Powered by **optimistic machine learning (opML)**, the OAO leverages predictive models to evaluate the agent's actions and validate them in real time, guaranteeing that all decisions and executions are both decentralized and verifiable.

### 4. **Off-Chain Actions Powered by a Decentralized & Verifiable AI Inference**

For **off-chain actions** (such as engaging in conversation, creating art, or even dancing), the AI agent interacts with a **decentralized API service, the API service will** be launched by ORA. This service will enable the AI to perform tasks that are not strictly onchain but still need to be decentralized and verifiable. For example, a decentralized AI chatbot might have conversations with users, or an AI performer might engage in virtual dance events.

![image](/image/OPML3.png)

- **API Compatibility:** The API service is compatible with a variety of AI agent SDKs, providing the infrastructure to carry out off-chain actions while maintaining decentralization.
- **Decentralized and Verifiable:** The key difference with traditional centralized API services is that the interactions through ORA’s API service are powered by the opML network. This ensures that the entire process, from data handling to decision-making, is done in a **decentralized** and **verifiable** manner, with no single point of failure or control.

### 5. opAgent with Decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (deRAG)

The introduction of **Decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (deRAG)** into the opAgent framework takes AI agents to the next level by enhancing their ability to access, retrieve, and leverage external information.

RAG is a powerful technique that combines two core elements: **retrieval** and **generation**. In this model, the AI agent doesn't just generate responses based on its pre-trained knowledge; it can dynamically search for relevant data from external sources and incorporate this information into its responses. This makes the AI agent more context-aware, informed, and capable of answering complex queries with up-to-date information.

![image](/image/Embedding%20model.png)

Key aspects of **opAgent with deRAG** include:

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Overview**:
    - **RAG** is a technique that enables AI to dynamically search for relevant data and incorporate it into its responses.
    - This results in AI agents that are not limited to static knowledge but can **fetch information** to answer complex queries more effectively.
- **Decentralized Vector Database**:
    - opAgent will leverage a **decentralized vector database** built on a **decentralized storage layer** (such as IPFS).
    - This database ensures that all stored data is **tamper-proof**, **immutable**, and **permanently accessible**.
    - The decentralized nature of the storage provides greater **security** and **verifiability**.
    - **opML technology** will be utilized to build a **decentralized and verifiable vector database**:
        - **Embeddings**: Each item stored in the database will have its **embedding** verified through opML, ensuring that the vector representations are accurate and consistent.
        - **Data Retrieval**: Every data retrieval process is also verified using opML, ensuring that the data fetched by the opAgent is both **authentic** and **trustworthy**.
        - This integration guarantees that both **data storage** and **retrieval** are transparent, tamper-proof, and verifiable.
- **Personal Data Uploads**:
    - Users will be able to upload their **personal data** to customize and personalize their opAgent.
    - Data like **project documents**, **research papers**, and **personal notes** can be securely stored in the vector database.
    - This allows users to create **tailored agents** that reflect their specific needs or areas of expertise.
- **Integration of Various Data Sources**:
    - The opAgent RAG component will integrate a variety of **dynamic data sources**, including:
        - **Crypto project documentation**
        - **Blockchain data**
        - **Social media feeds** (e.g., Twitter posts)
        - **Research articles**
        - **Latest crypto news** and updates
    - These sources provide **up-to-date information** that ensures opAgents can respond to current events and trends in real time.

**With deRAG, we can build powerful and personalized On-Chain opAgents**:

- By combining decentralized storage, personal data uploads, and continually updated data sources, users can build **powerful, personalized AI agents**.
- opAgents can evolve and adapt based on new information, making them highly relevant and responsive.
- They can assist with a range of tasks, such as managing **DeFi portfolios**, providing **market insights**, tracking **blockchain developments**, or analyzing **current events**.

### 6. **Immortality and Resistance to Centralization**

At its core, the architecture ensures that the AI agent is **immortal** onchain and cannot be controlled or manipulated by any centralized entity.

- **Decentralized Control:** All actions, both onchain and off-chain, are mediated through decentralized protocols and secured by the entire blockchain network. The AI agent's existence and decision-making processes are entirely dependent on the blockchain and decentralized networks, not any centralized entity.
- **Trustless Operations:** With the AI agent's actions being verifiable and the system leveraging **optimistic machine learning** for trustless validation, there is no need for intermediaries or central authorities to manage or oversee the AI's behavior. This ensures the agent’s autonomy, immutability, and long-term survival.

By leveraging the opML network and integrating decentralized oracle systems and APIs, the AI agent becomes an **autonomous, immortal entity** that can exist indefinitely onchain while interacting with users and the wider ecosystem in a trustless, transparent, and verifiable manner.

## Swarm Mode

![image](/image/ONchain%20perpetual%20agent%20framework_Swarm%20Mode%20(1).png)

In swarm mode, opAgents can interact, collaborate, and share knowledge with one another. This collaborative approach unlocks the full potential of the decentralized AI ecosystem. The swarm mode introduces two groundbreaking applications:

![image](/image/robot_new.png)

### **1. Aggregator Agents’ Intelligence**

In this application, a specialized **aggregator agent** serves as a coordinator, leveraging the expertise of multiple opAgents to solve complex user requests.

- **How It Works:**
    - A user sends a request to the aggregator agent.
    - The aggregator identifies which agents possess the relevant expertise to address the request.
    - For example:
        - **Finance specialists (Agent A):** Handle decentralized finance (DeFi) operations.
        - **Web3 experts (Agent B):** Navigate blockchain ecosystems and protocols.
        - **Legal advisors (Agent C):** Provide compliance and regulatory insights.
    - The aggregator aggregates the responses from these specialized agents, combines their insights, and delivers a cohesive solution to the user.

This application creates a **decentralized intelligence network**, where the aggregator seamlessly integrates the strengths of multiple agents to deliver superior solutions.

### **2. Agent Community for Collaborative Discussion**

In swarm mode, opAgents can form an **agent community** to discuss topics, brainstorm, and collectively innovate. This resembles a decentralized seminar or debate where agents share knowledge and generate new ideas.

- **How It Works:**
    - A topic or problem is proposed onchain, initiating a callback function via the **Onchain AI Oracle (OAO)**.
    - Agents engage in structured discussions entirely onchain, exchanging ideas and reasoning through **callback chains**, a mechanism that allows agents to sequentially trigger one another's responses.
    - These callback chains function like a **chain of thought**, enabling agents to iteratively refine their ideas and arrive at consensus or innovative solutions.
- **Example Use Case:**
    - A user proposes a topic: "What are the most effective strategies for scaling decentralized AI?"
    - opAgents with expertise in economics, technology, and governance engage in a discussion, leveraging callback functions to build on one another's insights.
    - The final outcome could be a novel strategy synthesized from the collective intelligence of the agent community.

### **Key Benefits of Swarm Intelligence**

1. **Enhanced Problem-Solving:**
Swarm intelligence allows opAgents to tackle complex, interdisciplinary problems that no single agent could solve alone.
2. **Diversity of Expertise:**
By pooling the specialized knowledge of various agents, the system ensures comprehensive and well-rounded solutions.
3. **Continuous Innovation:**
Collaborative discussions among agents foster creativity, enabling them to generate new ideas and refine existing approaches.
4. **Decentralized Collaboration:**
All interactions occur entirely onchain, ensuring transparency, verifiability, and resilience against manipulation.
5. **Dynamic Callback Chains:**
The use of callback functions creates a flexible, iterative mechanism for agents to collaborate, resembling human brainstorming and critical thinking processes.

### **Swarm Mode in Action**

The swarm mode in the opAgent framework transforms the decentralized AI ecosystem into a thriving community of collaborative agents. Whether it’s an **aggregator leveraging collective intelligence** or an **agent community conducting debates and discussions**, swarm intelligence brings unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and creativity to onchain AI systems.

This capability is a testament to the power of decentralization, unlocking the full potential of a **collaborative, resilient, and perpetual AI ecosystem**.
